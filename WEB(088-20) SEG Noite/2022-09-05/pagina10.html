		<p>Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans<br>
		Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
		There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
		Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
		Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
		But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br><br>

		Go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Johnny B. Goode<br><br>

		He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
		Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
		Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade<br>
		Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
		The people passing by they would stop and say<br>
		"Oh my what that little country boy could play"<br><br>

		Go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Go Johnny go go<br>
		Johnny B. Goode<br><br>

		His mother told him "someday you will be a man<br>
		And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
		Many people coming from miles around<br>
		To hear you play your music when the sun go down<br>
		Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
		Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br><br>

		Go go<br>
		Go Johnny go<br>
		Go go go Johnny go<br>
		Go go go Johnny go<br>
		Go go go Johnny go<br>
		Go<br>
		Johnny B. Goode</p>
